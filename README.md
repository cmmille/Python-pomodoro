# Python Pomodoro Timer
Set a pomodoro timer for yourself. During work time, you should be 100% focused on work. During break time, you should be 100% focused on anything but work. The pomodoro method requires a certain degree of self-control to ensure you are not on your phone or relaxing at all during work time, and not working at all during break times.
